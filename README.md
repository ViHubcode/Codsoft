CodSoft Data Science Projects

Welcome to my CodSoft Data Science Projects repository. This collection contains a series of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various data science projects I've worked on during my internship at CodSoft. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project included in this repository.

Projects
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
This project involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. We use machine learning algorithms to analyze the Titanic dataset and predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and more.

Dataset: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
Techniques: Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
In this project, we aim to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, where we apply machine learning models to identify fraud.

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
Techniques: Data preprocessing, Resampling (SMOTE), Feature Scaling, Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn
3. Movie Recommendation System
This project focuses on building a recommendation system for movies. Using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, we develop a system that recommends movies to users based on their past preferences and similarities between movies.

Dataset: MovieLens dataset
Techniques: Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise
